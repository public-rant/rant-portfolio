## PLANNING

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're reading this chapter, we assume that you've completed the
"Basics" problem set and are going to stay with the course for the rest
of the semester. Welcome. Now it is time to plan your work during the
core of the course.

Everyone in this course will be building an online learning community, a
site where users teach each other. The work may be done alone or in
groups of two or three students. Ideally, you or your instructors will
find a real client for you, someone who wants to publish and administer
the community on an ongoing basis. A good client would be a non-profit
organization that wants to educate people about the subject surrounding
its mission. A good client would be a medium-sized company that wants a
knowledge-sharing system for employees. A good client would be a student
group at your university. If you can't find a client, pick something
that you're passionate about. It could be Islamic architecture. It could
be African Cichlids (a family of freshwater fishes, living mostly in the
rift lakes of East Africa; see ). It could be cryptography. Pick
something where you think that you can easily get or generate *magnet
content*, some tutorial information that will attract users to your
service.

You are building the same type of project as everyone else in the class.
Thus it will be easy for you to compare approaches to, for example, user
registration or content management.

Before you starting writing code, however, we'd like you to do some
planning and competitive analysis. Fundamentally you need to answer the
questions "Who is going to teach what to whom?" and "What alternatives
are currently available for this kind of learning?"

### USER CLASSES

Start by dividing your users into classes. Two users should fall into
the same class if you expect them to want substantially the same
experience with your service. It is almost always useful to think about
different levels of administrative privileges as you are dividing the
users into classes. It is almost never useful to think about teachers
versus learners; the whole point of an online community is that each
user learning some of the time and each user is teaching some of the
time.

#### EXAMPLE USER CLASS DECOMPOSITION ON PHOTO.NET

To give you an idea of what a user class decomposition might look like,
we'll walk through one for .

First, consider the overall objective of photo.net: A place where a
person can go and get the answer to any question about photography.

Second, consider levels of administrative privilege. There are
**site-wide administrators**, who are free to edit or delete any content
on the site. These administrators also have the power to adjust the
authority of other users. We have **moderators** who have authority to
approve or delete postings in particular discussion forums. Finally
there are **regular users** who can read, post, and edit their own
contributions. A less popular service could probably get away with only
two levels of admin privilege.

A different way of dividing the users is by purpose in visiting the
service:

FIXME

A final way of dividing users that may be useful is by how they connect.
In the case of photo.net, it is easy to envision the **Web browser
user**. This user is uploading and downloading photos, participating in
discussions, reading tutorials, shopping for equipment, etc. The same
person may connect via a mobile phone, in which case he or she becomes a
**mobile user**. If the mobile user is in the middle of a photographic
project, we want to provide information about nearby camera shops,
processing labs, repair shops, time of sunset, good locations, and other
useful data. If the mobile user is connecting for social purposes, we
need to think about what are practical ways for a person on a mobile
phone to participate in an online community. Our engineering challenge
is similar for the **telephone user**.

### USAGE SCENARIOS

For each class of user, you should write down a rough idea of what a
person in this class would get from your new service. You may want to
hint at page flow.

#### EXAMPLE: NOVICE PHOTOGRAPHER SHOPPER AT PHOTO.NET

The novice should start by reading a bunch of carefully authored
camera-buying advice articles and then reviews of specific cameras. Much
of the best shopping advice is contained in question-and-answer
exchanges within the discussion forums so editors will need a way to
pick out and point to the best threads in the forum archives. After our
user has read all of this stuff, it would be ideal if he or she could be
directed into a Q&A forum where "here's what I've decided to buy; what
do you think?" questions are welcomed. That could be implemented as an
explicitly social shopping system with one column for responses from
other readers and an adjacent column for bids from camera shops.

#### EXAMPLE: SITE-WIDE ADMINISTRATOR AT PHOTO.NET

The site-wide administrator should log in and see a page that gives the
pulse of the community with statistics on the number of new users
registered, the quantity of photos uploaded into the photo sharing
system, the activity in the discussion forums, the relative efforts of
the moderators (volunteers from the community). If there are unbanned
users who have been responsible for an onerous amount of moderator work
in deleting off-topic postings, etc., these should be listed with a
summary of their problematic activities and an option to ban.

### EXERCISE 1A

Answer the following questions:

FIXME

Make sure that your answers to this and all subsequent exercises are
Web-accessible. It is a good idea to get into the discipline of ensuring
that all documents relevant to your project are available on the project
server itself, perhaps in the directory.

### EXERCISE 1B: BUILD USER PROFILE PAGES

When building an application it would be ideal to have the potential
users in the room with you at all times. Their needs would then be
concrete and manifest. This isn't very practical, however, and therefore
as an aid to making the people for whom you're building the application
concrete, you should build two or three profile pages. A profile page
contains the following information: (a) a picture of the user, (b) the
user's name, age, occupation, marital status, housing situation, and
income, (c) the user's short-term and long-term goals relevant to the
online community that you're building, (d) the immediate questions that
this user will bring to the site, (e) the kind of computer equipment and
connection in this person's house, and (f) any other information that
will help to humanize this fictitious person.

To assist you in this task we've created a couple of examples for an
online learning community in the area of general aviation:

FIXME

If you don't have a good photo library of your own, lift photos (with
credit) from photo.net and other online sources.

Don't spend more than one hour on this exercise; plenty of truly awful
software has been written with fancy user profiles on the programmers'
desks. There is no substitute for launching a service to real users and
then watching their behavior attentively.

### EXERCISE 1C

For each class of user identified in Exercise 1a, produce a textual or
graphical usage scenario for how that user will experience your service.

### EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES: OFFLINE

Whenever Nick Gittes (1902â€“2000; grandfather of one of the authors)
would see a computer advertised on television, he'd say "A home
computer. Why would anyone want a thing like that?"

The dotcom boom is over. You ought to have a good reason for building an
information system. If a curmudgeon wants to know why you need all these
fancy computers instead of a book, some chalk, and pencil and paper, it
would be nice to have a convincing answer.

There are good reasons to look at the best elements of offline resources
and systems. After several millenia, many of these systems are
exquisitely refined and extremely effective. Your online community and
technology-aided learning environment can be much improved by careful
study of the best offline alternatives.

#### EXAMPLE: POPULAR PHOTOGRAPHY MAGAZINE

The largest circulation offline publication in the U.S. world of
photography is the sixty-five-year-old magazine Popular Photography. It
is extremely effective at answering the following questions: What is the
price of a Nikon 50/1.4 lens? What are the latest cameras available? How
does the new Canon Elan 7 body perform on a test bench?

The magazine is ineffective for start-to-finish learning. It is
impossible for Popular Photography to sell enough ads to run a
twenty-page tutorial article much less a complete beginner's textbook on
photography. The magazine is ineffective for finding the average price
for a used or obscure item. (Shutterbug is the place for used and
classic camera dealer ads.)

The magazine is ineffective as a means of getting answers to arbitrary
questions. There is a "Too Hot to Handle" section in every issue that
promises "Honest, forthright answers to your most probing questions."
Unfortunately, only four questions are answered per issue. Presumably
these were submitted at least a couple of months previously. And the
answers come only from the editors of the magazine; they don't tap the
reserves of knowledge that may reside among the hundreds of thousands of
subscribers.

The magazine is ineffective as a means of exhibiting reader work. The
"Your Best Shot" column displays five or six reader-contributed photos
in every issue, but being selected is a slow and uncertain process.

#### EXAMPLE: FACE-TO-FACE COURSE

The main strength of a face-to-face course in photography is guaranteed
mentoring. The instructor keeps track of each student's progress and
questions. Another strength of a face-to-face course is the availability
of critiques from other students and the instructor.

Face-to-face courses require more travel, time, effort, and commitment
than many people are able to give. Once the course is over, the student
is unable to avail him or herself of mentoring and critiques from the
instructor and other students.

### EXERCISE 2

Write down the best features of offline alternatives for learning the
subject matter of the service that you're building. Indicate those
features that you think can be translated into an online community and,
if so, how. Write a three-sentence justification for why your online
learning community will be an improvement over offline alternatives for
at least some group of people.

### EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES: ONLINE

In performing your analysis of online competitors you should look at any
service or resources for learning in your subject area. But pay special
attention to online learning communities. Before setting off to surf,
you might find it useful to think about the following elements of
sustainable online community:

1.  magnet content authored by experts
2.  means of collaboration
3.  powerful facilities for browsing and searching both magnet content
    and contributed content
4.  means of delegation of moderation
5.  means of identifying members who are imposing an undue burden on the
    community and ways of changing their behavior and/or excluding them
    from the community without them realizing it
6.  means of software extension by community members themselves

When you visit a site ask yourself "Did they author or license a
substantial body of tutorial content?" Look at the ratio between
publisher-authored and user-authored content. If more than half of the
content is authored by users, the site is heading away from *publishing*
and toward *community*. Note the number of different ways in which a
user can post some information that then becomes available to other
users ("means of collaboration"). See whether the default search utility
on the site returns results from things like discussion forum postings.
As an unprivileged user, it will be hard for you to determine whether or
not the site has provisions for distributing the content moderation
burden or excluding difficult users. However, you can sometimes make
inferences about Element 6, whether or not the software can be extended
by people who are regular users and administrators of the community but
aren't expert programmers. If the site is commercial, check the job
listings to see what skills are required. If the site hasn't adopted the
abstract URL religion (see "Basics" chapter) the file extensions may
give you a clue as to implementation technology. A ".pl", ".asp",
".php", ".adp", or ".tcl" indicates the use of a scripting language
amenable to program extensions by novices. A ".jsp" or the term
"servlet" in the URL indicates the use of Java, a language that is
intended only for professional programmers.

### EXERCISE 3

Find the best existing online communities in your subject area. Note how
closely they conform to the six elements of sustainability listed above.
Also write down anything strikingly good or bad about the registration
process and the mechanisms of collaboration, e.g., in discussion forums,
comments on articles, and chat rooms. Look for voice and mobile
interfaces. If present, try them out. ( provides a list of desktop
browser-based phone emulators so that you won't have to use your mobile
phone; alternatively type "WAP emulator" or "Mobile browser emulator"
into a public search engine.) Look for evidence of personalization and
direct controls over preferences.

### DOES THE WORLD NEED MORE THAN ONE ONLINE COMMUNITY?

Suppose that in Exercise 3 you found 100 online communities in your
subject area. Should you be discouraged? A search at amazon.com for
"aquarium" yields 679 books on the subject of keeping fish at home. The
National Center for Educational Statistics () found that there were 3913
colleges and universities in the United States in 1998. The computing
world historically has tended toward concentration. There is only room
for one or two desktop user interfaces, one or two word processors, one
or two spreadsheets, a handful of enterprise accounting systems, etc.
Two factors prevent similar concentration in the world of online
learning communities. One is the idiosyncracy of authorship. A person
may believe that Anna Karenina is the best novel ever written and
simultaneously be interested in reading C. D. Payne's . A moviegoer may
believe that Gone with the Wind will never be excelled and yet still
invest two hours in . The range of idiosyncracy is narrower in
explicitly tutorial works. Nonetheless one can admit the towering
accomplishment of Stroebel's and still profit from working through
(Bernhard Seuss 1995).

The second force that prevents concentration in the world of online
learning communities is the nature of community itself. Christopher
Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray Silverstein argue in (Oxford
University Press 1977) against countries of more than a few million
people:

> "It is not hard to see why the government of a region becomes less and
> less manageable with size. In a population of N persons, there are of
> the order of N^2 person-to-person links needed to keep channels of
> communication open. Naturally, when N goes beyond a certain limit, the
> channels of communication needed for democracy and justice and
> information are simply too clogged, and too complex; bureaucracy
> overwhelms human process. ...
>
> "We believe the limits are reached when the population of a region
> reaches some 2 to 10 million. Beyond this size, people become remote
> from the large-scale processes of government. Our estimate may seem
> extraordinary in the light of modern history: the nation-states have
> grown mightily and their governments hold power over tens of millions,
> sometimes hundreds of millions, of people. But these huge powers
> cannot claim to have a natural size. They cannot claim to have struck
> the balance between the needs of towns and communities, and the needs
> of the world community as a whole. Indeed, their tendency has been to
> override local needs and repress local culture, and at the same time
> aggrandize themselves to the point where they are out of reach, their
> power barely conceivable to the average citizen."

If it were possible for everyone to pile into a single community and
have a great learning experience, America Online would long ago have
subsumed all the smaller communities on the Internet. One of the later
chapters of this book is devoted to the topic of growing an online
community gracefully to a large size. But, for now, rest assured that it
is a hard problem that nobody has solved. Given sufficiently high
quality magnet content and an initial group of people dedicated to
teaching, there will always be room for a new learning community.

### EXERCISE 4

Identify sources of magnet content for your community this semester. If
some of this content is going to come from other people, write to them
and ask for permission. Even if you're only using their work
experimentally, one concern that an author or publisher might have is
that your site will get indexed by search engines and readers will be
misdirected to your site instead of theirs. In practice, this is not a
problem if your server isn't accessible from the public Internet or if
you include a file that will instruct search engines to exclude certain
content. You may get a friendlier response from copyright holders if you
agree to provide a hyperlinked credit and to ensure that their content
does not become multiply indexed.

If you have a client who is supplying all the magnet content, write down
a summary of what is going to be available and when. Next to each class
of documents note the person responsible for assembling and delivering
them. As an engineer, it isn't your job to assemble and develop content,
but it is your job to identify risks to a project, such as "not enough
magnet content" or "nobody has thought about magnet content".

### DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable hostnames, e.g.,
, into machine-readable and network-routable IP addresses, e.g., . DNS
is a distributed application in that there is no single computer that
holds translations for all possible hostnames. A domain registrar, e.g.,
, records that the domain servers for the google.com domain are at
particular IP addresses. A user's local *name server* will query the
name servers for google.com to find the translation for the hostname .
Note that there is nothing magic about "www"; it is merely a
conventional name for a computer that runs a Web server. The procedure
for translating a hostname such as is the same as that applied for
translating .

### EXERCISE 5: SETTLE ON A HOSTNAME

Working with your client, pick a hostname for the application that
you'll be building this semester. If you're building something within
MIT, for example, you'll probably want to pick . You and your client
will need to navigate the IT bureaucracy to register that hostname and
map it to the IP address of your server. If you're building a service
for a client who does not have an Internet domain, encourage them to
come up with a good name and register it. The authors have had good
experience with , a service that includes bundled use of their DNS
servers; the domain owner can edit the hostname-to-IP-address
translations with a Web browser interface.

### EXERCISE 6: NEGOTIATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

One of the thing that distinguishes a professional software engineer is
success in negotiating intellectual property rights. If you give away
all rights to everything that you produce as a "work for hire", you
won't have a personal toolkit of software that you can reuse on new
projects. If you don't give away any rights, nobody will be able to run
your software, which probably means that you won't be able to solve
social or organizational problems. A good negotiator gives away things
that are valuable to the other side, but that aren't valuable to his or
her side.

During this course, for example, you will ideally want to retain
ownership of all software that you produce. You will therefore be free
to reuse the code in any way, shape, or form. The client, however, is
going to be putting in a lot of time and effort working with you over a
period of months and is thus entitled to some benefit. Your university
tuition payments have probably drained away all of the cash in your bank
account and therefore you won't be giving the client money as
compensation for his or her time. What you can do is give the client a
license to use your software. This obviously benefits the client but it
also benefits you. The more people that are out there happily running
your software the better your professional resume looks.

Should you try to limit what the client can do with your software?
Generally this isn't worthwhile. Any organization that comes to you for
programming assistance is probably not an organization that will want to
hang out a shingle and offer to develop software for others. If they do
decide that it would make sense to adapt your software to another
application within the company, it is very likely that they will call
you first to offer a consulting fee in exchange for your assistance.

How about limiting your liability? Oftentimes software engineers are
called upon to write programs whose failure would have catastrophic
results. Suppose that you are offered \$100,000 to write a trading
program for an investment bank. That may seem like a great deal until
the bank sues you for \$100 million, alleging that a bug in your program
cost them \$100 million in lost profits. In the biomedical field a bug
can be much more serious. There is the famous case of the Therac-25
radiation treatment machine, bugs in whose control software cost lives
(see ).

Disclaiming liability is difficult, even for trained lawyers, and hence
this is best left to professionals. Nearly every commercial software
license includes a disclaimer of warranty. Here's a snippet from the
Microsoft End User License Agreement (EULA):

> 19\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY

This is so important to Microsoft that it is the only part of a
twelve-page agreement that is printed in boldface and the only part that
is presented in a French translation for Canadian customers as well.

If you don't want to cut and paste Microsoft's verbiage, which might
expose you to a copyright infringement action from Redmond, consider
employing a standard free software or open-source license, of which the
GNU General Public License is the best-known example. Note that using a
free software license doesn't mean that your software is now free to the
world. You may have licensed one client under the GNU GPL but whether or
not you decide to offer anyone else a license is a decision for the
future.

If you wish, you can use as a starting point in negotiating rights with
your client. And remember that old bromide of business: *You don't get
what you deserve; you get what you negotiate.*

### MORE

FIXME

### TO THE INSTRUCTOR

It is helpful during the second meeting of the class to bring clients on
campus to give three-minute presentations pitching their projects. Here
is a suggested outline to the client for the presentation:

1.  introduce the speaker and the organization he or she represents (15
    seconds)
2.  explain who the users are and why they need to interact via an
    Internet application, i.e., what problem is this online community
    solving (1.5 minutes)
3.  describe how users will be attracted to the site initially, e.g., is
    there a collection of magnet content that these people need that
    isn't available anywhere else? (30 seconds)
4.  after the site has been up and running for a few months, what will a
    typical interaction look like for a new user? (30 seconds)
5.  what will happen after the semester is over, how will the system be
    funded and sustained? (15 seconds)

The client should be prepared to answer questions for a minute or two
after the presentation.

### TIME AND MOTION

This problem set involves a two-hour meeting with the client, perhaps
two hours of discussion and Web surfing among the students, an hour to
build the user-profile pages, two hours of writing. That's seven hours
total, most of which requires the entire team to work together.
